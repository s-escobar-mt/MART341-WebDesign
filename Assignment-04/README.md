  Web browsers are software programs that allow devices to access the internet.\
they fuction by taking requests from the user (via user interface rendered with a rendering engine),\
sending it to servers over the network , and recieving content (JavaScript) from servers to be\
interpretted by the browser specific interpreter so that it may display the page properly.

2. Define and describe DOM\
Document Object Model\

so that JavaScript and other programming languages can modify it

XML describes the nodes that HTML can display used for simplified data sharing through plain text format \
and data not lost through upates, tags are not pre defined as they would be in HTML or XHTML\
XHTML is most similar to HTML but more strict in in requirements thus requiring more coding time while\ 
being easier to maintain long term than HTML

<head> <-------- head start

</html> <---------- root end
```
